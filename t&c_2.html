Where does Glossier ship?
Glossier currently ships to the 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, and France. You may experience longer delivery times when shipping to Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and remote areas up north in Canada.

We are working on bringing Glossier everywhere around the world. Tag us @Glossier to let us know where you live!

Tell me about shipping to the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
We offer two shipping speeds, because sometimes you can wait and sometimes you can’t.

Standard (5-9 business days): $4.50
Rush (1-2 business days): $25
PS: Standard shipping is free when you spend $30 or more. Please allow 1 to 2 business days for us to receive and process your order. Please note, We only offer Rush Shipping to the 48 contiguous states.

When will my order ship?
Here’s how it works: you order, we process, then we ship.

Ordering takes a few seconds. Processing takes 1 to 2 business days (and orders placed after 1pm ET are processed the next business day). Then one of our carriers takes it from there. You’ll get a shipment notification email with a tracking number as soon as your package ships. It’s on the way!

How long will it take to ship to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico?
You might experience a few extra days in shipping timelines. Shipping to these states will take about 11-15 business days.

I'm having problems with the tracking.
Sorry about that! In a few cases, the carrier takes 1-2 business days to register your shipment status. If your tracking number isn’t updating or working at all, please reach out to us as soon as you can via gTEAM@glossier.com. We can give you the inside info.

How can I edit my shipping address?
If your order is shipping to an incorrect address, please email gTEAM@glossier.com.

How can I change the country I am shopping in?
To change the currency you’re shopping in (and country you’re shipping to), just click the little circle on the upper right corner of your screen and select the correct country. Right now, we only ship to the countries listed here (but more are coming soon).

Are there limitations with shipping fragrance in the U.S.?
Since fragrance is considered a Hazardous Material (HAZMAT), the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) requires ground-only shipment of Hazardous Materials due to air shipment restrictions and regulations. Alas, fragrance products and samples cannot be shipped to to Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Territories, PO Boxes or APO/ FPO addresses. All orders containing Hazardous Materials must be shipped via standard ground shipping methods and cannot be shipped via expedited shipping methods.

How can I find out more information about a product?
You can learn all about our products on their individual product pages. If you have any other questions or thoughts, let us know by emailing gTEAM@glossier.com.

What skin types are Glossier products suitable for?
Our products are appropriate for all skin types: they’re dermatologist tested, hypoallergenic, non-irritating, and paraben free.

Will my product melt/dry/freeze/expire/etc.?
If the product is subjected to excessive heat or cold for short periods of time, it will not impact the product’s efficacy, though it may result in a thicker or thinner texture.

While the products don’t have a formal expiration date, it is generally recommended that they be used within 3 years of manufacture or 6 months after opening for best product quality...but we think you’ll love them so much that this won’t even be an issue.

Do you test on animals?
Great question—no, we don’t! The Gloffice often hosts animal visitors (a Shih Tzu mix named Burger, a Dachshund Beagle mix named Bruce), and we wouldn’t dream of testing on them or any of their friends.

Can I sell the products on my own site?
Unfortunately, your purchase of Glossier products is only for your personal use. By purchasing Glossier products, you agree not to resell or distribute such products for any commercial purposes. We may reject or cancel an order if we have reason to believe that your order is not for your personal use.

How can I pay with a gift card?

What can I do if my payment is declined?
Oh no! Here are a few things to check if your payment didn’t go through: Check that your card’s billing details (such as the security code and billing address) match what you’ve entered into our system.

Is your card expired?
Your card issuer may have declined your payment. They don’t tell us the reason for this, so it’s best to check with them before trying your card again. If none of these apply, please contact us at gTEAM@glossier.com. We’re happy to help!

Glossier FAQ
How are Glossier products different from other beauty brands?
Our products reflect our belief that beauty should be fun, easy, imperfect, and personal. Our formulas are designed to live with you, not on you, and enhance what you already have. They are meant to be touched, smooshed, traveled with, cherished, and shared until their packages are crinkly and dirty and can literally give no more. They represent fun and freedom, and are the result of years of recommendations from the coolest girls on the planet.

When is the next product launching?
We’ll be coming out with new products very soon—sign up with your email address to get the latest updates.

I have a weird question and I want to talk to a person about it.
We’ve got people who love that kind of thing. To ask anything and get a quick, personal reply, email us at gTEAM@glossier.com. Don’t worry—we check it constantly.

Order Questions
How can I update my order?
Please email us at gTEAM@glossier.com as soon as possible if you would like to cancel or change your order. Our fulfillment center processes orders quickly, but we’ll do our best to process your request.

How can I check the status of my order?
You can view order status on your Account page, which will be updated as soon as you are charged for your shipment and again once your order ships.

Can I use multiple promo codes at checkout?
You can use one promo code per order. If you’ve encountered two valid Glossier promo codes during your travels through the Internet, please choose the one you want to use more.

Can I use a promo code on top of another promotion?
You can use a promo code along with free shipping when you buy two or more items. Other offers advertised on the website without a code will be automatically applied and cannot be used along with a separate promo code. If your order qualifies for an advertised offer and you also enter a promo code, we’ll apply the best deal.
